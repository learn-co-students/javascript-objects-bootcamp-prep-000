// My objects.js

/*
Instructions
Open objects.js

Assign an object to the variable playlist and initialize the object with a key-value pair â€” the keys will be artist names and the values will be song titles. (What limitation does this impose on our playlist?)

Create a function updatePlaylist that accepts three parameters: the playlist (an object), an artist name (a string), and a song title. The body of the function should add the song and artist as a key-value pair to the playlist object. The function should return the whole playlist.

Create a function removeFromPlaylist that accepts two arguments (the playlist object and the artist name). The body of the function should delete the key-value pair from the playlist and return the updated playlist.
