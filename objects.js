var playlist = {'Elvis Presley' : "Blue Christmas", Aerosmith: "Dream On", tenthAvenueNorth: "You Are More"};

function updatePlaylist (playlist, nameOfArtist, titleOfSong) {
  return Object.assign(playlist, {[nameOfArtist]: titleOfSong});
  
  /* This works, too, for now:
  playlist[nameOfArtist] = titleOfSong;
  return; (should technically say "return playlist;") */
  // Remember to enclose any variable keys in brackets!!!
}

function removeFromPlaylist (playlist, artistName) {
  delete playlist[artistName];
  return playlist;
  //return; (incorrect, but still passes)
}
// Looks like the tests forgot to check whether updatePlaylist and removeFromPlaylist return the updated playlists.
/* A note on terminology regarding the following line of code:
var meals = { breakfast: "toast and eggs" };
meals is the object
breakfast is the key
"toast and eggs" is the value
{breakfast: "toast and eggs"} is the property (though some would say that breakfast is the property)
Some would say that the statement " meals.breakfast = 'oatmeal'; " is a property
