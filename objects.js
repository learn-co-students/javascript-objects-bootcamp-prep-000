// 1. Open `objects.js`
// 2. Assign an object to the variable `playlist` â€” the keys will be artist names and the values will be song titles. (What
// limitation does this impose on our `playlist`?)
// 3. Create a function `updatePlaylist` which accepts three parameters: the playlist (an object), an artist name (a
// string), and a song title. The body of the function should add the song and artist as a key-value pair to the playlist
// object. The function should return the whole playlist.
// 4. Create a function `removeFromPlaylist` which accepts two arguments (the playlist object and the artist name). The
// body of the function should delete the key-value pair from the playlist and return the updated playlist.
var playlist = {artist: undefined};

function updatePlaylist(playlist, artist, song) {
  playlist[artist] = song
  return playlist;
}

function removeFromPlaylist(playlist, artist) {
